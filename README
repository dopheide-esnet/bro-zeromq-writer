Bro ZeroMQ Log Writer Plugin
============================

A Bro log writer that sends logging output using ZeroMQ.

This plugin uses the ZeroMQ "publish-subscribe" pattern, where Bro is
the publisher and a user-provided program is the subscriber.

Bro publishes each log record as a ZeroMQ multi-part message containing
two parts:  the first part contains the Bro log path (e.g. "conn"), and the
second part contains the log record in JSON format.  The first message part
is needed so that the receiving process knows which type of log record is
being received, and it can also be useful to allow filtering of incoming
messages.


Installation
------------

This plugin has been tested against the latest release of ZeroMQ, which at
the time of this writing is v4.2.2.

Before attempting to build this plugin, make sure you have installed
ZeroMQ (http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software).

Next, build and install this Bro plugin using the following commands
(replace BRO_SRC_DIR with the top-level directory of the Bro source code)::

    # ./configure --bro-dist=BRO_SRC_DIR
    # make
    # sudo make install

Run the following command to ensure that the plugin was installed
successfully::

    # bro -N NCSA::ZeroMQWriter
    NCSA::ZeroMQWriter - ZeroMQ log writer (dynamic, version 0.1)


Logging to ZeroMQ
-----------------

In order to enable logging to ZeroMQ, add the following lines to local.bro
(change the specified hostname and port number to suitable values for
your setup)::

    @load NCSA/ZeroMQWriter
    redef LogZeroMQ::zmq_hostname = "localhost";
    redef LogZeroMQ::zmq_port = 12345;
    redef LogZeroMQ::send_logs += { HTTP::LOG, DNS::LOG, Files::LOG };

After running "broctl deploy", Bro will write the logs you specified
in "LogZeroMQ::send_logs" to the specified hostname and TCP port number
using ZeroMQ.  The regular ASCII logs will also still be written as usual.

Instead of specifying which logs to send, one could instead specify which
logs to not send (all others will be sent).  To do this, just replace
"send_logs" with "excluded_log_ids"::

    @load NCSA/ZeroMQWriter
    redef LogZeroMQ::zmq_hostname = "localhost";
    redef LogZeroMQ::zmq_port = 12345;
    redef LogZeroMQ::excluded_log_ids += { Conn::LOG, DNS::LOG };
